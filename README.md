## The Nonviral Times News App

A coronavirus free news source.

## Motivation

The Nonviral Times is a news source that is devoid of any coronavirus related news. Showing how the world continues move on outside of this pandemic. It accomplishes this by making a call to the "News API," returning all articles published in the last 48 hours and parses out any articles that mention keywords such as "coronavirus", "COVID-19", "quarantine," or "pandemic." Insuring the user a coranavirus free experience.
