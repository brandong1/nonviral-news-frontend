## The Nonviral Times News App

A coronavirus free news source.

## Motivation

It's 2020, and the coronavirus has seemingly affected every aspect of our lives. For those who would like to take a mental break from the virus we created "The Nonviral Times." The Nonviral Times is a news source that is devoid of any coronavirus related news. Showing how the world continues move on outside of this pandemic. It accomplishes this by making a call to the "News API," returning all articles published in the last 48 hours and parses out any articles that mention keywords such as "coronavirus", "COVID-19", "quarantine," or "pandemic." This insures the user a coranavirus free experience.
